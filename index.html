        <div class="fw-content">
            <h5> A firewall plays a vital role in network security and needs to be properly configured to keep organizations protected from data leakage and cyberattacks.
                This is possible by configuring domain names and Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to keep the firewall secure. Firewall policy configuration is based on network type, such as public or private, and can be set up with security rules that block or allow access to prevent potential attacks from hackers or malware.
                Proper firewall configuration is essential, as default features may not provide maximum protection against a cyberattack.
                Firewall configuration steps can vary depending on the specific firewall software and hardware you are using. However, the following is a general step-by-step guide for configuring a firewall:
                </h5>
        </div>
        <div class="fw-content2">
            <p>    <span> - Determine the firewall policy: Before configuring the firewall, you should define the security policy for your network. Decide what types of traffic should be allowed and what types should be blocked. You may want to consult with your organization's security policy and compliance requirements to help define your firewall policy. <br>
            <p>    <span> - Choose your firewall software/hardware: Select the firewall that best fits your requirements. If you are using a hardware firewall, you will need to purchase and install it. If you are using software, you may need to install it on a server or workstation.<br>
            <p>    <span> - Configure the firewall software/hardware: Once the firewall is installed, you will need to configure it. This typically involves setting up rules to allow or block specific types of traffic. <br>
            <p>    <span> - Configure the network topology: Configure the network topology to reflect your security policy. This may involve setting up VLANs, subnets, and other network segmentation measures. <br>
            <p>    <span> - Test the firewall: Test the firewall to ensure that it is functioning as expected. This may involve performing penetration testing or other security testing to ensure that the firewall is properly protecting your network. <br>
            <p>    <span> - Monitor and maintain the firewall: Monitor the firewall to ensure that it continues to function as expected. This may involve logging and reviewing firewall activity, applying security updates, and modifying firewall rules as necessary to reflect changes in your security policy. <br>

            <h3>RANSOMWARE</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="r-box">
            <h5>
                Ransomware is a type of malicious software that is designed to encrypt or lock a victim's files or entire computer system, rendering it unusable. The attackers then demand payment, usually in the form of cryptocurrency, in exchange for a decryption key that will unlock the victim's files. </h5>
        </div>
        <div class="s-content">
            <br> <span> Ransomware attacks often begin with a phishing email or other social engineering tactic that tricks the victim into downloading the malware. Once the malware is installed, it can spread throughout the victim's network and encrypt all accessible files. To protect against ransomware attacks, it is important to maintain up-to-date backups of important files, use anti-virus and anti-malware software, avoid opening suspicious emails or clicking on links from unknown sources, and keep all software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches. <br>
